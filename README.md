# Malicious Traffic Classification in MQTT-IoT Networks

## Overview  
With the rapid growth of IoT devices, ensuring robust security measures is essential to defend against malicious network traffic. 
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks implementing **statistical moments difference thresholding (SMDT)**,
a feature selection technique that enhances IoT network security by identifying key features for **malicious traffic classification**. 

The study evaluates feature selection effectiveness using the **MQTTset dataset** ([available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cnrieiit/mqttset))
and applies **binary and multiclass classification** using seven machine learning algorithms.
The goal is to **reduce feature dimensionality** while maintaining **high detection accuracy**, making the approach suitable for resource-constrained IoT environments.
